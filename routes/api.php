| Here is where you can register API routes for your application. These
| routes are loaded by the RouteServiceProvider within a group which
| is assigned the "api" middleware group. Enjoy building your API!
|
| Note: Notification routes have been moved to:
| routes/vendor/v3_1/api/notifications.php

// Main API routes are now organized in versioned directories
// Please check the appropriate version folders for specific routes
